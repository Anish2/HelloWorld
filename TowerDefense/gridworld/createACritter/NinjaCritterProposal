Externally Observable Behavior:
My Critter will do nothing until an actor who is equal to another actor target(which is passed in by the constructor)
is within a radius of two spaces. Once such an actor is within a radius of two spaces, my critter will kill the actor 
and move to the killed actors location.
It will then wait for another victim that is equal to target to come within a two space radius,
and repeat it's previous actions.

Methods I will override:
getMoveLocations() will return an empty Arraylist if the target is not within the killing radius,
else it will return the target to kill's location in an Arraylist.
