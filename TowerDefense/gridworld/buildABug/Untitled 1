1) My bug hunts down and eats rocks in a 2x2 area. It also hunts down rock bugs, and prioritizing those over normal rocks, even if in the middle of hunting down a rock.
If there are no rocks in the two by two area, the bug turns.
When you run my tester, you should look for the antirock bug to hunt down rocks.

2)I chose to add the method getRocks because i wanted to make my code easier to understand and i also feel that i may want to reuse that specific bit of code in a later project.
Also, making that method will make it easy for my bug to be extended and made to hunt down other types of objects besides for rocks and antirock bugs. I also overode move as i did not want
my bug to lay down flowers.
